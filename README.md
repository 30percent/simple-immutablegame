### Simple 'Immutable state' based game engine

An attempt at making a very simple game engine managed via typescript and immutablejs. The idea being that each state is safe from every consecutive state, allowing for recovery, and better management during pause/debug/save.

#### To Run

Simply execute `npm start`. It should open a browser window. You control 'Jack' via arrow keys.
